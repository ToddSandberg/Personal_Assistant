# Personal_Assistant WIP

This app will eventually be a voice controlled chat bot similar to Alexa or Google Home, but with a more personal aspect.

## Current State:

Responds to hello with the users name and a greeting appropriate to the time of day. If its the first start up of the day it gives the weather.

### Current commands:
"take a log": starts a log entry for the current day and saves to a text file when you say "that's it".
"play today's log": play whatever has been recorded today for the log.
"goodbye": stops listening.
"i'm going to bed": sets an alarm if you want and stops listening. (Does not actually set an alarm yet)

## Goals:

- Daily log that can later be analyzed to find cause effect relationships for habits and moods
- Morning debriefing (Calendar, News, etc.)
